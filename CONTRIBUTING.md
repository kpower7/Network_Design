## üìã Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start

- Review existing [issues](https://github.com/your-org/scm275x-clustering/issues)
- Check the [project roadmap](https://github.com/your-org/scm275x-clustering/projects)
- For major changes, create an issue first to discuss your proposal
- Ensure your contribution aligns with supply chain optimization best practices

### 2. Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/scm275x-clustering.git
cd scm275x-clustering

# Create a new branch for your contribution
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Set up development environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Gurobi license (for optimization work)
# Follow instructions at: https://www.gurobi.com/academia/
```

### 3. Making Changes

#### For Optimization Models:
- Ensure mathematical formulations are clearly documented
- Include performance benchmarks and validation
- Test with multiple data scenarios
- Document computational complexity

#### For Analysis Notebooks:
- Ensure all cells run without errors
- Include clear explanations and business context
- Add data validation and error handling
- Test with different input datasets

#### For Code Contributions:
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Add comprehensive docstrings
- Include unit tests for new functions
- Optimize for performance where applicable

### 4. Testing Your Changes

```bash
# Run all notebooks to ensure they execute
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace *.ipynb

# Run unit tests (if applicable)
pytest tests/

# Check code style
flake8 .
black --check .

# Validate optimization models
python -m pytest tests/test_optimization.py
```

### 5. Submitting Your Contribution

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add improved clustering algorithm with demand weighting"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
